# RACIPE-modified-
RACIPE, but with some modifications (multithreaded, terminal output, efficiency, etc)
The ids file version enforces a node order, but is ad-hoc (features like using a cfg file are unavailable)

You will need glibc version >=2.28 to run the code.
classifyracipe_error classifies the data. Run RACIPE using k times the number of parameter models you want, where k is the number of repetitions you want for error barplots.
